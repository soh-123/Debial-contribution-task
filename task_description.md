Project Description
Experiment to modernize the Debian Wiki

The Debian Wiki runs MoinMoin which is becoming not so user-friendly and hard to maintain. The idea of this project is to experiment with a migration to a more modern Wiki, which could still be MoinMoin but version 2.0, this new version for instance supports pages in Markdown. An outline of what would be this project:

1) Investigate with the Debian Wiki team what is missing to migrate data to MoinMoin version 2.0.

2) Create a plan of action.

3) Set up a service, initially in parallel to the current Wiki, but running MoinMoin 2.0. Making both instances access the same database.

 

Internship Tasks
The project will start with a discussion with the team taking care of the Debian Wiki to agree on a solution. After that, the coding starts, some corner cases are expected along the way, and we want to cover most of them to make the future content migration smoother.

Project Contribution Information
As part of the application process, all applicants must make at least one contribution to be accepted as an intern for this project. Only applicants who make a contribution will be eligible to be accepted as interns.

Some projects accept contributions through a project repository. This project has not provided a link to a project repository.

Since this is a new project, created from scratch, the contribution to select an intern is to write a simple script that reads the News page in the Debian Wiki , parse the data and write its content to a file in Markdown.
